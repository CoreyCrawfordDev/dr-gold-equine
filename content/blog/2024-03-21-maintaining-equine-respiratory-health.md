Respiratory health is crucial for a horse's performance and overall well-being. As an equine internal medicine specialist, I've seen how proper management can prevent many respiratory issues. Here's what you need to know about maintaining your horse's respiratory health:

## Common Respiratory Issues
- Inflammatory Airway Disease (IAD)
- Recurrent Airway Obstruction (RAO, or "heaves")
- Exercise-Induced Pulmonary Hemorrhage (EIPH)
- Viral and bacterial infections

## Environmental Management
### Stable Environment
- Ensure adequate ventilation
- Use low-dust bedding (shavings or paper)
- Keep stalls clean and dry
- Avoid storing hay above stalls
- Consider using hay steamers for dusty hay

### Pasture Management
- Turn out as much as possible
- Avoid dusty turnout areas
- Provide shelter from extreme weather
- Consider using a grazing muzzle if needed

## Feeding Practices
- Feed hay from the ground when possible
- Soak hay for 10-15 minutes before feeding
- Consider using haylage or other low-dust alternatives
- Ensure clean, fresh water is always available

## Exercise Considerations
- Warm up properly before intense work
- Allow adequate cool-down time
- Monitor breathing during exercise
- Adjust workload based on air quality
- Consider using a heart rate monitor

## Vaccination and Prevention
- Keep up with core vaccinations
- Follow your veterinarian's recommended schedule
- Isolate new horses for 2-3 weeks
- Practice good biosecurity measures

## Signs of Respiratory Distress
Contact your veterinarian if you notice:
- Increased respiratory rate at rest
- Nasal discharge
- Coughing
- Exercise intolerance
- Flared nostrils
- Abnormal breathing sounds

## When to Seek Veterinary Care
Immediate veterinary attention is needed for:
- Severe respiratory distress
- High fever (>102Â°F)
- Thick, colored nasal discharge
- Sudden onset of symptoms
- Decreased appetite or energy

Remember, prevention is always better than treatment. Regular veterinary check-ups and good management practices can help keep your horse's respiratory system healthy.
