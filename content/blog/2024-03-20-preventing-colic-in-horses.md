Colic is one of the most common and potentially life-threatening conditions in horses. As a veterinarian specializing in equine internal medicine, I often see cases that could have been prevented with proper management. Here are some key strategies to help prevent colic in your horses:

## 1. Consistent Feeding Schedule
- Feed horses at the same times each day
- Make any feed changes gradually over 7-10 days
- Provide constant access to clean, fresh water
- Avoid feeding on the ground where sand or dirt can be ingested

## 2. Proper Diet Management
- Feed high-quality hay and/or pasture
- Limit grain/concentrate intake
- Ensure adequate fiber intake (minimum 1.5% of body weight daily)
- Consider using slow-feed hay nets to mimic natural grazing

## 3. Regular Exercise
- Daily turnout is ideal
- Maintain consistent exercise routines
- Avoid sudden changes in activity level
- Provide opportunities for natural movement

## 4. Dental Care
- Schedule regular dental exams (at least annually)
- Address sharp points and dental issues promptly
- Ensure proper chewing and digestion

## 5. Parasite Control
- Follow a strategic deworming program
- Perform regular fecal egg counts
- Rotate pastures when possible
- Clean manure from paddocks regularly

## 6. Stress Management
- Maintain consistent routines
- Provide social interaction with other horses
- Ensure adequate shelter and comfort
- Minimize sudden changes in environment

## When to Call Your Veterinarian
If you notice any of these signs, contact your veterinarian immediately:
- Pawing or looking at flank
- Rolling or attempting to roll
- Lack of appetite
- Decreased or absent manure production
- Elevated heart rate (>50 bpm)
- Sweating or signs of distress

Remember, early intervention is crucial in colic cases. Don't hesitate to call your veterinarian if you suspect your horse might be colicking.
